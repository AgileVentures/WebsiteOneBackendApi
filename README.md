## A little History
The main website for [AgileVentures](agileventures.org), was previous a monolithic [Ruby on Rails application](https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne).
Recently, a group of awesome people started building/exporting the front-end of the same website on a [React front-end application](https://github.com/AgileVentures/agile-ventures-website-react-front-end)
during React mob sessions and also during their own time.
This project was started after the React project was complete or rather plugged into the existing website. This project mission is to power most of the api end-points for 
the React front-end, clean-up and refactor some existing code and add addidtional features that will improve the AgileVentures Website.
